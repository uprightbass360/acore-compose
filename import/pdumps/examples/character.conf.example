# Example character import configuration
# Copy this file to configs/yourcharacter.conf and modify as needed

# Target account (required if DEFAULT_IMPORT_ACCOUNT is not set)
# Can be account name or account ID
account=testuser

# Rename character during import (optional)
# Must follow WoW naming rules: 2-12 letters, no numbers/special chars
name=NewCharacterName

# Force specific character GUID (optional)
# If not specified, next available GUID will be used automatically
# guid=5000

# Additional notes:
# - Account must exist in auth database before import
# - Character names must be unique across the server
# - GUID conflicts will cause import to fail
# - Use dry-run mode to test before actual import
